Live Wallpaper Chrome App
========================

The goal of this project is to provide an app that can set a live wallpaper on ChromeOS devices using existing ``` </canvas>``` ```</video>```based animations from the web with minimal mofifications.

All that has to be done is simply open the app the way you would any other app and the animation/video will start.
For convenience, you may pin the app shortcut to your taskbar.

It even works while showing the lock screen!

Right now, it is set to display the nature timescape originally from the chromebook pixel but, you can change that to any video url you want as long as it points to a valid html5 video file!
